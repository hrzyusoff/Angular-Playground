routerLink = "";
used by absolute and relative

ABSOLUTE PATH
- start with /{{path}}
- it is like main path
e.g
1. Home
2. About
3. Product

RELATIVE PATH
- wo start with /{{path}}
- path that depending on main path
e.g
1. Home
2. About
3. Product
  3.1 Sport
  3.2 IT

Router can be injected
1. Declare in constructor(private router: Router)
2. this.router.navigate(['path'])
   - in navigate we can do both absolute and relative
   - for absolute use it as usual
   - for relative just extended this.router.navigate(['path'], {relativeTo: this.route}) 
     but before that in constructor we need to declare private route: ActivatedRoute

Also can receive parameter
product/sport/:type <- dynamic
